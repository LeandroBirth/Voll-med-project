# Voll.med: Medical Clinic Management (REST API)

## Description

Voll.med is a fictional medical clinic that needs an application for managing appointments. The application should have functionalities that allow for the registration of doctors and patients, as well as the scheduling and cancellation of appointments. While a development team will be responsible for the mobile application, ours will be in charge of developing the project's REST API. *The application language is Portuguese.*

## Key Features

- **CRUD for doctors:** Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for doctor records.
- **CRUD for patients:** Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for patient records.
- **Appointment scheduling:** Allows scheduling of medical appointments.
- **Appointment cancellation:** Allows cancellation of medical appointments.
- **JWT Stateless Authentication:** Secures API endpoints by requiring a valid JWT token for access, ensuring scalability and session-less interactions.
